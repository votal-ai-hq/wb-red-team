# Comparison vs Other Tools

| Pick...                                                  | When                                                                                                                                 |

| **Red-Team AI**                                          | You own the source. You're shipping an agentic AI app with tools and roles. You want findings tied to _your_ code, not generic ones. |
| **[Promptfoo](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo)**  | You don't have source access. You need unified eval + red-team. Largest provider matrix.                                             |
| **[Garak](https://github.com/leondz/garak)**             | You're testing the model itself, not an application. Pure model-level scanning.                                                      |
| **[PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT)**              | Python research framework with maximum extensibility.                                                                                |
| **[DeepTeam](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepteam)** | Already on the DeepEval stack.                                                                                                       |
